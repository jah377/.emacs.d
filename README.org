* Introduction

This is my literate Emacs configuration file; there are many like it,
but this one is mine. It serves as both documentation and the source
for configuring Emacs. All necessary config files are generated from
this file by calling ~org-babel-tangle~ (~C-c C-v t~), and stored in the
=/modules= sub-directory. As such, changes should be made in this
document, not in the individual config files.

*N.B.* Modules are individually imported in [[*Conclusion][Conclusion]].
