* TODO Configure python-mode                                      :package:

:project:  python

- State "TODO"       from              [2024-11-05 Tue 15:30]
  Organize list of resources for configuring =python-mode=
:END:

* TODO Add docs/ denote silo in .emacs.d?                         :feature:
:PROPERTIES:
:project: denote
:END:
:LOGBOOK:

  Documentation in =READEME.org= should focus on /why/ I configured Emacs the way I
  did. However, it seems like a good idea to create a =docs/= subdirectory to
  document how to use the various packages found in my configuration.

* TODO Fix loading of dired-x                                         :fix:
:PROPERTIES:
:project: dired
:END:
:LOGBOOK:

  At startup, =dired= is initialized but not configured. Calling ~M-x dired~ should
  trigger the configuration of =dired=, =dired-x=, =dired-aux=, and
  =nerd-icons-dired=. For some reason, =dired-x= is not configuring despite the
  same ~:commands~, ~:after~, and ~:ensure~ =use-package= handles. _I don't know why
  this is_.
:END:

* TODO Document org-agenda configuration                            :notes:
:PROPERTIES:
:project: org-agenda
:END:
:LOGBOOK:
- State "TODO"       from              [2024-11-05 Tue 15:38]

  The =add-org-agenda= branch includes a minimal configuration of =org-agenda=. I
  need to document the settings and functionality by the changes.
